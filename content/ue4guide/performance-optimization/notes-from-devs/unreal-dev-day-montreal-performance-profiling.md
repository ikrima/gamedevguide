Dev build -> Noise in draw thread; Test is cleanest

Profiling from editor:

\->Play in Standalone

\->Make sure Editor not updating in real time & not updating in background

\->Make sure frame rate smoothing is off & vsync is off

\->Minimize editor

\->Don't profile from PIE

net.DumpRelevantActors

to run on server: cheat net.\* command

stat net (4.19)

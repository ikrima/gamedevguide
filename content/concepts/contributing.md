Ghost is completely open source software built almost entirely by volunteer contributors who use it every day.

The best part about structuring a software project this way is that not only does everyone get to own the source code without restriction, but as people all over the world help to improve it: Everyone benefits.


## Development guide

If you're a developer looking to help, but you're not sure where to begin: Check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/labels/good%20first%20issue) label on GitHub, which contains small pieces of work that have been specifically flagged as being friendly to new contributors.

Or, if you're looking for something a little more challenging to sink your teeth into, there's a broader [help wanted](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/labels/help%20wanted) label encompassing issues which need some love.

When you're ready, check out the full **[Ghost Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)** for detailed instructions about how to hack on Ghost Core and send changes upstream.


## Other ways to help

The primary way to contribute to Ghost is by writing code, but if you're not a developer there are still ways you can help. We always need help with:

- Helping our Ghost users on [the forum](https://forum.ghost.org)
- Creating [tutorials](https://ghost.org/tutorials/) and [integration guides](https://ghost.org/integrations/)
- Improving our [documentation](https://github.com/tryghost/docs/) _(what you're reading now!)_
- Testing and quality assurance
- Hosting local events or meetups
- Promoting Ghost to others

There are lots of ways to make discovering and using Ghost a better experience.

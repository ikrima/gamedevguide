  Anchor

## Introduction
Anchor will automatically generate for your markdown pages based on headings.

To create a heading, add one to six `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

```sh
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

The anchor will be generated with different layers based on the size of the heading.

### Example

Check the anchor on the right.

  Quick Start

The website is based on Gatsby, full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://gatsbyjs.org/).

## Create a Gatsby site.

  Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

  ```sh
  gatsby new gatsby-starter-markdown https://github.com/cvluca/gatsby-starter-markdown
  ```
## Start developing.

  Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

  ```sh
  cd gatsby-starter-markdown/
  gatsby develop
  ```

## Open the source code and start editing!

  Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
   
  *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

# 2019 Overview Material

[GPU Architectures](../assets/resources/2019_cerrato_gpu_arch_talk.pdf) by Maurizio Cerrato (@speedwago) is a concise but accessible crash course into how GPU hardware works. He even touches on how mobile GPUs differ with Tile Based Deferred Rendering architectures

[2019 Triangles Are Precious](../assets/resources/2019_baumeister_triangles_are_precious.pdf) by Dominik Baumeister is a good complement to the talk above

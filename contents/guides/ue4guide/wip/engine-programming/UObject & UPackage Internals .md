All unreal objects have unique path in the form of string:

/Game/MyGame/MyAsset.Myasset.ASubObjectOfMyAsset.AnotherObject

 

If you split the path using dot as delimiter you will get:

 

1. /Game/MyGame/MyAsset

2. MyAsset

3. ASubObjectOfMyAsset

4. AnotherObject

 

 

Outer most object is awlays a UPackage

-   In this example, it's /Game/MyGame/MyAsset

 

Object flags: Tell us the state of the object

-   RF\_Public =&gt; this object is visible outside of its package

    -   Example of non-public object is a sub-object

    -   Every object you can see in editor is Public

-   RF\_Standalone =&gt; Doesn’t need to be referenced to not be garbage collected

    -   If containing package gets unloaded, then it gets GC'ed

-   RF\_Transactional =&gt; property changes are recorded and can be reverted

 

Class flags: tell about the object's UClass

-   CLASS\_Abstract =&gt; Class can't be instantiated

-   CLASS\_Native =&gt; Native class

-   CLASS\_Constructed

 

All native classes get populated in /Script/\[ModuleName\].

 

Native classes do not get a PostLoad

 

Constructor:

-   Object is still abstract entity

 

PostInitProperties:

-   Properties initialized, including any set from config inis

-   Ready to interact with the world

 

 

Serialized Assets get PostLoad

-   PostLoad is where default properties that are changed in the editor get loaded into the object

-   The reset to default yellow arrow simply applies the property's value from the CDO back into the current objects' property
